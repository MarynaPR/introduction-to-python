# Writing Tests

As software grows, the need for testing grows.

We write tests to be able to test our assertions and make sure our code is working as expected.

This is a good way to make sure that our code is working as expected and that we don't have any bugs.

It also makes sure that we don't have any typos or errors.

It also makes sure that we don't have any unexpected behavior.

It also allows us to develop faster and more efficiently.
